This is a simple Binary Search Tree suitable for strings that I implemented in C++ with a simple test file.  It is built
on top of an even simpler binary node class that I also coded, below are some descriptions of the 
files and their functionalities.

Makefile: make file for the project, default command is make tree, which will compile the project

BinaryNode.h: a class definition for the binary node

BinaryNode.cpp: a class implementation for the binary node

BinarySearchTree.h: a cumbersomely named class definition for the binary search tree

BinarySearchTree.cpp: a cumbersomely named class implementation for the binary search tree

BSTPathTest.cpp: prints the path to a node chosen by the user, given a tree defined by the user.

a.out: a compiled executable of BSTPathTest.cpp
