This is a simple text-based postfix notation calculator that I implemeted in C++ 
on top of a stack implemetation that I also coded from scratch.  Below is included
a breif description of each file and its functionality.

stack.h: The header file describing the stack class

stack.cpp: implementation of the stack class

postfixCalculator.h: a description of the postfixCalculator class

postfixCalculator: a stack-based implementation of the postfixCalculator class suitable for basic arithmetic
