These are a few of the python scripts I have made.  I find it hard to justify the creation of a script to do anything really, 
but these exist to show that I can do it.  Python is a little more accessable when it comes to scraping webpages and writing
to files than JavaScript, so they are mostly of that nature.  Below is enclosed a list of files with funtionalities as usual.

roman.py: a script that takes a decimal number and returns its representation as a roman numeral

spellcheck.py: a script that will work as long as the CS dept of UVa keeps its dictionary hosted at that url.  It checks an input
for misspelled words, and returns a list of the words misspelled.

scrape.py: scrapes a webpage and outputs it to a file called scrape.html

collatz.py: returns the smallest number with greater than or equal to n steps to one via the collatz function

Overscrape.py: takes in battletag, region, and platform and returns basic data about a public overwatch profilem and ends
by printing that player's competitive ranking.
