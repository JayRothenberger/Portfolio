This is a hash table that I implemented in C++ from scratch.  Attached
to the hash table is file called wordPuzzle.cpp that completes a word
search on one of the grid files.  I wrote the algorithm that searches
through the word grid for the words in the dictionary, and I am particularly
proud of its efficientcy.
